# Multilingual Low-Latency Emergency VoIP System Using LLM for Speech Reconstruction and Blockchain for Secure Data Archiving

A real-time emergency communication system that processes VoIP calls through Twilio with multilingual speech-to-text transcription, AI-powered context-aware responses using RAG (FAISS + GPT), and automatic severity classification. Emergency transcripts are securely stored on Arweave blockchain with encryption keys distributed via Shamir secret sharing across epoch servers. Access control is managed through Solana multisig governance requiring proposal approval for data retrieval, with support for epoch-based key rotation ensuring long-term security compliance.
